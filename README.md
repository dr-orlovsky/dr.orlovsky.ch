# Dr Maxim Orlovsky

I am transhumanist and cypherpunk doing science, engineering and business activities.&#x20;

My primary focus is building foundations for the future - foundations, which will unlock full potential of individuals, enabling self-sovereignty, privacy and censorship-resistance. This is the future of vertical progress and humanity evolution into forms much outside of what current collectivistic society can propose or allow.

## Expertise

Area of my expertise include:

* Neuroscience & medicine (pathophysiology)
* Evolutionary biology
* Complexity science (emergency, non-linear science, cellular automata)
* Machine learning and artificial intelligence
* Distributed computing
* Programming languages and virtual machines
* Applied cryptographic systems
* Game theory
* Digital finance and legal systems

## Bio, awards

I was born in 1980 in Ukraine (it was USSR back those days). In 2006 I had moved to Kyiv and later, in 2018, to Switzerland.

At school I was fond of biology, mathematics and computers: I learned C in 1994, and x86 assembler in 1996, when I was 16 (I had wrote my first virus in raw x86 bytecodes). The same year I won regional informatics competition.

My passion to biology resulted in multiple first places I took on biological competitions in 1994-1996 including first place on the World Biological Competition in 1995, for what I received personal grant from the President of Ukraine. This also had opened a door into science: I entered local Medical University and from the first year started performing scientific work on the department of pathological physiology in the field of neuroendocrinology, with emphasize on hypothalamic circuit and neuropeptides produced by the brain. In 2005 for this research I received a National Science Prize, granted by the President of Ukraine.

In 2005 I received invitation from the [Lindau Nobel Laureates](https://www.lindau-nobel.org/) committee to attend yearly Nobel Laureates meeting – a one-in-lifetime opportunity awarded to most promising world scientists.

In parallel with my scientific activities I continued programming, doing tools for the scientific research. Specifically, in 1997-2006 I had developed and mantained several generations of  digital image analysis system, which used cellular automation, cluster analysis and neural networks for automatic detection, measurement and classification of biological cells and objects on microscopic images. This system was used in 6 different PhD works, including my own.

I was doing research during my student years in parallel with usual University's study program and got a PhD degree in medicine (neuroscience) in 2004 at Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology at Kyiv just two years after University graduation. In two years I moved to Kyiv and started work in this institution, to focus more on scientific studies (before that time I was a Professor Assistant at University, which was taking too much of my time outside of science).

In 2005 and 2006 I had won a grant program from European Union (INTAS) for a post-doctoral research in the field of brain mechanisms of stress management, which was performed at the Bristol University.

In 2007 I got fully dissatisfied with the state of scientific progress at academia and decided to move into technological business. I had founded my first IT product company doing a "web operating system" in 2007 in London, which resulted in a complete failure: with the 2008 financial crisis coming I was not able to attract investments required to bring already developed product to the market.

In 2009 I had returned back from London to Kyiv and established a software service company,  which lately started doing banking software. This had brought me into digital finance field ("fintech") and into close relations with internals of the banking industry.

In 2010-2014 I was working as a part-time Professor Assistant on the dept. of pathophysiology at the National Medical University at Kyiv – a tribute to my past academic activities, which ended up with a Maidan Revolution, when we also had dismatled corrupted rector of the University; however the new rector was not in favor of our "revolutionist" activities and cancelled contracts with all participants of the uprising.

By that time I also got quite dissatisfied with the inefficiency of the modern financial industry, and together with other players in banking industry we had created Ukrainian Bitcoin Foundation in 2014, which promoted bitcoin and blockchain technologies to the government and National Bank. The results of our activity are globally known: Ukraine had become leading country in bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption with one of the most liberal rules.

In 2017 I decided to quit business in Ukraine and focus on developing technologies and global business in the field of decentralized systems and its applications. I also decided to spend time only on things which may have a global impact and enable vertical progress, changing the status quo of the stagnating human civilization – the story told on this website in the sections above.
