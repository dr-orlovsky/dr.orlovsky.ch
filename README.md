# Dr Maxim Orlovsky

I am a transumanist and cypherpunk doing science, engineering and business activities. My primary focus is building foundations for the future which will unlock full potential of individuals through technology enabling self-sovereignty, privacy and censorship-resistance, leading to a vertical progress and further humanity evolution into forms much outside of what current collectivistic human society can propose or allow.

Area of my expertise include:

* Neuroscience & medicine (pathophysiology)
* Evolutionary biology
* Complexity science (emergency, non-linear science, cellular automata)
* Machine learning and artificial intelligence
* Distributed computing
* Programming languagues and virtual machines
* Applied cryptographic systems
* Game theory
* Digital finance and legal systems

## Technologies designed by me

## Activism

I have founded or being an active participant and adviser to the following projects aiming to change the status quo of the existing balance of powers in the world:
